## Basically, there are 3 types of ML Algorithms:

* Supervised Learning  
    The algorithm is given a set of input data. The algorithm then should map the given input to an output. 
    Therefore, we give the algorithm a training data set which gets analyzed and produces internal rules, which can be used for mapping new input data to the correct output.   
  Examples: 
    * Support Vector Machines
    * Naive Bayes
    * KNN
    * Random Forest
    * Linear Regression
    * Decision Trees
* Unsupervised Learning  
  The algorithm is trained with unlabeled data, so the algorithm should rather detect patterns , group similar data to present the data in a meaningful way to the user.  
  **Clustering** is the task of diving data points into groups such that data points in the same groups are similar.  
  Example: 
  * K-Means
    
* Reinforcement Learning  
The machine should make meaningful decisions. Mostly, the machine is exposed to an environment giving it a goal and the machine trains continually using trial and error. The machine tries to learn from past experiences.  
  Example:
  * Markov Decision Process
  * Q-Learning
